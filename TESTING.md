# Testing

## Behat tests
Behat configuration uses multiple extensions:
- [Drupal Behat Extension](https://github.com/jhedstrom/drupalextension) - Drupal integration layer. Allows to work with Drupal API from within step definitions.
- [Behat Screenshot Extension](https://github.com/integratedexperts/behat-screenshot) - Behat extension and a step definition to create HTML and image screenshots on demand or test fail.
- [Behat Progress Fail Output Extension](https://github.com/integratedexperts/behat-format-progress-fail) - Behat output formatter to show progress as TAP and fail messages inline. Useful to get feedback about failed tests while continuing test run.
- `FeatureContext` - Site-specific context with custom step definitions.

Add `@skipped` tag to failing tests if you would like to skip them.
